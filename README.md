lifx-midi
=========

## What is it?
This console app allows you to randomly change the colour of your LIFX whenever it receives a MIDI Note On message with velocity 127. My current setup uses a Novation Launchpad and Ableton Live with a drum rack.

## Pre-requisites
- gem install unimidi
- gem install lifx

## Instructions
- Open terminal
- Navigate to the Development directory
- ruby lifx-midi.rb
